# Breast Cancer Detection App

## Overview

The Breast Cancer Detection App is a web-based application designed to assist in the early detection of breast cancer. By inputting specific medical data attributes, the app uses a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer, helping healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple form-based interface for inputting data.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Instantaneous predictions based on input data.
- **Data Security:** Ensures that user data is handled securely and confidentially.
- **Model Accuracy:** Uses advanced machine learning models for accurate predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Necessary Python libraries installed: `Flask`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.
- A dataset for training the machine learning model (e.g., the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KARTHIKREDDY04/breast-cancer-detection-app.git
   cd breast-cancer-detection-app
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   
   - Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly and placed in the project directory.
   - Preprocess the data if necessary (e.g., handling missing values, normalization).

5. **Train the Machine Learning Model:**

   You can train the model using a provided script or manually via a Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

6. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. **Input Data:**
   - Navigate to the input form on the homepage.
   - Enter the following attributes:
     - Clump Thickness
     - Uniform Cell Size
     - Uniform Cell Shape
     - Marginal Adhesion
     - Single Epithelial Cell Size
     - Bare Nuclei
     - Bland Chromatin
     - Normal Nucleoli
     - Mitoses

2. **Submit Data:**
   - Click the "Predict" button to analyze the data.
   - The app will display the prediction result instantly.

3. **Interpreting Results:**
   - The app will provide a likelihood score or a classification (e.g., benign or malignant).
   - If the result indicates a high likelihood of cancer, consult a medical professional for further diagnosis.
